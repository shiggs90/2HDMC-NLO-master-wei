#: description: Expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on (sigma(pp->h)/sigma(pp->hSM)) * B(h -> aa -> bbtautau) as a function of m(a), where h(SM) is the Higgs boson of the standard model, h is the observed particle with mass of 125 GeV, and a denotes a light Higgs-like state, as obtained from the 13 TeV data.
