#: name: Exclusion limits on bbA, combined
#: description:  Observed (black solid) and expected (black dotted) limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the the cross section for bbA prodcution and the branching fraction $\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \tau\tau$, obtained from the combination of the $\mathrm{e}\tau_\mathrm{h}$ and $\mu\tau_\mathrm{h}$ channels in the 1 b tag category, as a function of the A boson mass. The green and yellow bands represent the one and two standard deviation uncertainties in the expected limits.
